    <br>On the mysterious woman’s back was a pair of green colored wings that appeared slightly illusionary. Those were likely formed from the amalgamation of her Dou Qi. The transformation of Dou Qi into wings was a symbol of those who were Dou Wang or stronger.
    <br>The mysterious woman lightly stood in the sky. Her calm and beautiful face carried a gracefulness and nobility that the simple dress she wore could not hide.

    <p>She has a very serious and stern personality. It has been stated that she has dedicated her entire life to the martial arts and is uninterested in matters such as love and romance. She develops a soft spot for Xiao Yan after their first encounter and fell in love with him.</p>

    <h3>ជីវប្រវត្តិ</h3>
    <p>She was the Sect Leader of the Misty Cloud Sect till Yun Shan decided to side with the Hall of Souls and remove her from the position. She gave Nalan Yanran permission to break the marriage engagement with Xiao Yan...</p>
    <p>to get the purple crystal. She was defeated by the Winged Lion King. Xiao Yan found her unconscious near his cave and took care of her. After she recovered she saw that his Qi Method was a low-tier one and thought that maybe she should help him out since he had saved her. She left the cave to take a bath thus drawing wild beasts to it. Xiao Yan lured them away but received heavy injuries. Yun Yun took care of him during this time even though she was not accustomed to it. When making food for Xiao Yan, she accidentally added the aphrodisiac he had made previously. This made them uncontrollably lustful and since she could not control her Qi because of the Winged Lion's Seal she fell under its influence. Both of them started to kiss passionately and were on the verge of being intimate when Xiao Yan slapped his own face to recover from the aphrodisiac's influence. He then left the cave till they both were able to recover. Later with Xiao Yan's help, she obtained the Purple Crystal that left his Qi unstable because he had swallowed the Purple Amethyst Essence. She helped him stabilize his Qi and left him with a Qi Method, Dou Technique and her Sea Core Vest.</p>
    <p>She would run into Xiao Yan again when she was hired by Gu He to accompany him to the Tager Desert to try and bargain with Cai Lin for the Green Lotus Core Flame. At the time Xiao Yan was running for his life from Yue Mei who wanted to make him her sex slave. Her group rescued Xiao Yan and she warned him to leave the desert if he wanted to live. This surprised Gu He as he didn't think she would help out a Da Dou Shi. While her group was negotiating with Cai Lin, Xiao Yan stuck into the inner sanctuary and wanted for his chance to steal the heavenly flame. As her ans her group were battling the Snake-People leaders, Xiao Yan was watching Cai Lin use the heavenly flame to try and evolve. The flame destroyed her body and Xiao Yan took this time to steal the flame and also the take the Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python with him. She and the group chased after Xiao Yan and she told the group to leave the desert and she will retrieve the flame. As she the person with the heavenly flame the person stopped fleeing and stood on the ground waiting for her. Once she started talking Xiao Yan revealed himself and she was surprised that he was the one who took the flame. She let him know that she won't take it from him and will tell Gu He that the person escaped. They talked for bit before she invited him to join the Misty Cloud Sect. Xiao Yan got mad and started yelling at her and she couldn't understand why he was so mad. At this time she didn't know that he was Nalan Yanran's former fiancee and he didn't know that she was the one who gave Nalan Yanran permission to break the engagement. They separated and went their own way. She came under attack from members of the Snake- People and Xiao Yan had Yao Chen possess his body to save her. After saving her, she thanked him and he let her know that it was Xiao Yan who sent him and he wished to apologize for earlier.</p>
   <p>During the Three Year Agreement she was not present and returned after it was over to find a crying Nalan Yanran and then found out what had happened. After Xiao Yan came back to the Sect to kill Yun Leng for attacking his father and clan they come into conflict due to her position as the sect leader. As Xiao Yan is fleeing she is part of the group trying to capture him. He eludes everybody but she is waiting for him at exit of the mountains and asks Xiao Yan to come back to the sect with her. He tells her over his dead body and he starts to leave when she attacks him, but it is not an attack she is removing the tracing formation on him so he can escape. She tells him that there is no way for her to kill him and tells him not to come back to the Jia Ma Empire in the future. He hugs her and tells her he wishes he had been more bold when they first met and maybe they won't be in this situation and tells her inform Yun Shan that he will be back to collect his clans blood debt. <br>Xiao Yan met Yun Yun for the final time before she left the Jia Ma Empire.</p>
   <p>She would not see Xiao Yan till about three years later when come to collect his blood debt from the Misty Cloud Sect. Her cultivation has been sealed by Yun Shan and she is being forced to marry Gu He. Xiao Yan shows up on the day of the wedding with his allies to stop the wedding and destroy the sect. He first defeat Gu He in individual combat, but doesn't kill him to which Gu He was aware that if Xiao Yan hadn't have to held back on his final attack he would have been killed. After this an all out battle begins at the sect. As the battle continues Xiao Yan and his allies have the upper hand so Protector Wu reveals himself and joins the battle. Yao Chen goes to fight him as Xiao Yan continues to battle Yun Shan as their battle Xiao Yan uses the Angry Buddha Lotus Flame skills to heavily injure Yun Shan and as he is about to take his life Yun Yun as him to stop. She see in his eyes that he is affected by her words and this causes him to pause for moment but he proceeds with the attack killed Yun Shan. After the battle has been concluded she tries to take her own life to make amends for what the sect has done to Xiao Yan's family, but he stops her and tells her if she takes her own life he will kill every member of the sect. She asks him what does he want to do and finally due to his feelings for her he tells her to disband the sect in thirty days and he will let everyone left alive live. After everything is settles she decides she will leave the Jia Ma Empire for the first time. Nalan Yanran comes to tell Xiao Yan that they are leaving and he follows her to meet with Yun Yun. As Nalan Yanran watches Xiao Yan hugs and starts kissing Yun Yun. Yun Yun is surprised by his move, but lets him have his way for once. He would stay with her for 4 days before she and Nalan Yanran finally head to the central plains.</p>
   <p>She and Nalan Yanran have joined Flower sect only because Yun Yun liked the atmosphere there so she took a guest Elder position. She and Nalan Yanran decided to stay there for a prolonged period originally, if no accident occurred, someone like she and Nalan Yanran would not stir much ripple within the Flower Sect. After all, with their strength, they can only be considered average within the Flower Sect. This situation had started to change on the second year after she and Nalan Yanran joined the Flower Sect. At that time, she and Nalan Yanran found a mountain within the territory of the Flower Sect to stay as both of them also thought that they were the only ones on the mountain. While Yun Yun was randomly roaming around she found a cave where an old woman with crippled legs was staying. The temperament of this old woman was rather strange and eccentric. She directly use her hand to strike Yun Yun and sent her flying after she was discovered causing Yun Yun to suffer some injuries. Yun Tun she was not angry about this and later everyday she would bring food and this lasted for two years. After two years, that old woman was finally willing to leave the cave and stayed with them for a year.</p>
   <p>  After that old woman had lived with them for one year and her temper became much better. They finally learned that her name is Granny Hua. However, they were uncertain of just what she does and didn't discover that she was an expert. After staying with them she finally reached the end of her life and transferred all her Qi into Yun Yun's body and her jade tablet and asked her to become the Sect leader of the Flower Sect. Yun Yun was quite helpless in the face of this kind of sudden situation and was not interested in being the whatever chief of the Flower Sect. After a period of time Hua Jin showed up and request the Jade Tablet which Yun Yun gave her. Hua Jin would then come back to the Dou Qi that was sealed in her body and if it was taken out it would also kill Yun Yun. She was not willing to fight, but Nalan Yanran went to the Falling Star Pavilion without her knowledge to get help from Xiao Yan. Once Nalan explained the situation he immediately left for the Flower Sect. It should originally be considered fair if it is a match but the Flower Sect possesses rule that a man and woman can fight an opponent together. Hua Jin would fight together with her boyfriend Yaohua Liangjunn. Yun Yun has already agreed to this match being constantly pestered Hua Jin so she couldn't back down. Xiao Yan showed up as the fight was going to start and said he was Yun Yun's man and her will fight with her. She asked him why he was there and her told her "don't you think you have hid for me long enough." She told him who is hiding and he said who is the one who has come. He then announced he was a disciple of Yao Chen and paid his respects to the elders of the Sect. He made a request which the elders agreed to and that was if Yun Yun wins she will become the sect leader. The elders agreed to his request and the fight began with Xiao Yan telling Yun Yun to just wait here and I will take care of everything. He then summoned his Sky Demon Puppet to fight Hua Jin while he would fight Yaohua Liangjun. He avoided Yaohua Liangjun's attacks while he created the Angry Buddha Lotus Flame and then released it on Yaohua Liangjun. Yaohua Liangjun was not able to withstand the attack and fled from it causing him to forfeit the match. Xiao Yan then summoned the heavenly flames to create another Angry Buddha Lotus Flame but Hua Jin admit defeat. The match was really a joke. A four star Dou Zun and a six star Dou Zun were defeated in the hands of a two star Dou Zun. If this matter was to spread, it would really be a source of a joke. Xiao Yan left after he opened a small rip on the Dou Qi sealed in Yun Yun so she could adsorb the Qi faster.</p>
   <p>She didn't encounter Xiao Yan again till they were going to the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree and the Flower sect was being attacked by the Profound Sky Sect. Xiao Yan arrived and killed all the members of the Profound Sky Sect and they accompanied him to the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree. She received a Bodhisattva Seed from Xiao Yan after the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree rewarded him with several for removing the evil Qi from its body. At the end of the Novel Xiao Yan asked her to return to the Jia Ma Empire which made her extremely happy.</p>
